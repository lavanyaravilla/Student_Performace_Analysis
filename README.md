Analysis of Student Performance Data for Anomaly Detection and Pattern Recognition

Background: 

In this analysis, you will explore a dataset representing the daily performance of 10 students over a 30-day period.


Dataset Overview: Each student attempted between 35 to 50 questions daily. These questions were distributed over four chapters, with varying levels of difficulty and engagement requirements. The performance status for each question is recorded as "Correct", "Incorrect", or "Unattempted".


Objectives:


Trend Analysis: 

Identify and visualize the trends in student performance over the 30-day period. Analyze these trends by chapter and across the entire dataset.

Anomaly Detection:

Fatigue or Boredom Effects: Detect any days with an unusual increase in "Incorrect" and "Unattempted" answers, which might suggest fatigue or boredom, particularly in the middle of longer chapters.

Impact of External Events: Identify days where there is a noticeable spike in "Unattempted" answers, potentially indicating external events or disruptions affecting student engagement.

Random Performance Fluctuations: Spot patterns where student answers reflect randomness, suggesting days when students struggled significantly with the material.

Pattern Recognition:

Determine if there is a learning curve visible where students start with poorer performance at the beginning of each chapter but improve as they become more familiar with the content.

Assess whether performance varies significantly from the start to the end of each chapter, suggesting review or fatigue effects.

Recommendations: 

Based on your analysis, provide recommendations on potential academic interventions that could help improve student engagement and performance. 

Deliverables:

A comprehensive report including graphs and tables to support your analysis.
